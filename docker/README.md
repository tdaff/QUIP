QUIP - QUantum mechanics and Interatomic Potentials
===================================================

**This build does not include the GAP framework**
**Details of obtaining a GAP enabled Docker image will be added soon**

The QUIP package is a collection of software tools to carry out 
molecular dynamics simulations. It implements a variety of 
interatomic potentials and tight binding quantum mechanics, and 
is also able to call external packages, and serve as plugins to 
other software such as LAMMPS, CP2K and also the python framework 
ASE. Various hybrid combinations are also supported in the style 
of QM/MM, with a particular focus on materials systems such as 
metals and semiconductors.

This image contains a scientific stack with Python, Julia and
precompiled binaries of QUIP and quippy.
